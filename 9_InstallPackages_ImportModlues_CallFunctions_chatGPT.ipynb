        "> A <font color = 'red'> **Python library**</font> refers to a collection of modules or functions that provide specific functionality, often focused on a particular domain or purpose. Libraries can be used to extend the capabilities of Python by providing pre-written code that can be imported and used in your own programs. Examples of popular Python libraries include NumPy for numerical computing, pandas for data manipulation and analysis, and requests for making HTTP requests. On the other hand, a <font color = 'blue'> **Python package**</font> is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy. A package is essentially a directory that contains one or more Python module files, along with an optional __init__.py file that signifies it as a package. Packages help to organize and structure large codebases by grouping related functionality together. They can also contain sub-packages, creating a nested structure.\n",
